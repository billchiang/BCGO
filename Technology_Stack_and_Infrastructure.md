# Technology Stack and Infrastructure Considerations

This document outlines the proposed technology stack and infrastructure considerations for the comprehensive AFP document generation, conversion, delivery, and management system.

## 1. Consolidated Technology Stack

This section details the recommended technologies for building the various microservices and components of the platform.

*   **Primary Programming Languages & Frameworks:**
    *   **Java with Spring Boot (Primary for most backend services):**
        *   **Justification:** Robust, mature ecosystem with extensive libraries for enterprise applications (e.g., Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring AMQP for RabbitMQ). Strong performance, good for building scalable microservices. Large talent pool available. Chosen for services like Core AFP Generation Engine, AFP Conversion Module wrapper, Email Sender Service, SMSSenderService, AppPushService, CustomerProfileService, and potentially a dedicated Orchestration Service if not using Airflow for all orchestration.
    *   **Python with Apache Airflow (for Workflow Orchestration):**
        *   **Justification:** Airflow is Python-native, making it the natural choice for defining and managing complex batch workflows (DAGs). Python's scripting capabilities are also excellent for operational tasks and smaller utility services.
    *   **.NET Core (Alternative for backend services):**
        *   **Justification:** A viable alternative to Java/Spring Boot, especially if the development team has strong C#/.NET expertise. Offers high performance, a modern framework, and excellent cross-platform support. Libraries like MailKit for email are robust.
    *   **JavaScript/TypeScript with a modern frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js - for Visual Template Builder UI):**
        *   **Justification:** Standard for building interactive web-based user interfaces. The choice of specific framework can depend on team preference and existing skillsets.

*   **Databases:**
    *   **PostgreSQL (Primary Relational Database):**
        *   **Justification:** Powerful open-source RDBMS with strong support for transactions, JSONB (for flexible data like template structures or preferences), and scalability. Good for structured data like job statuses, customer profiles (if relational model is chosen), and application metadata.
    *   **MongoDB (Alternative/Supplementary NoSQL Database):**
        *   **Justification:** Suitable for storing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as customer preferences, template definitions (especially if highly dynamic or complex JSON), or logs. Offers horizontal scalability and flexibility. Could be used for the `CustomerProfileService` or `TemplateManagementService` if a document-oriented model is preferred.
    *   **Prometheus (Time-Series Database for Metrics):**
        *   **Justification:** Industry standard for storing time-series metrics data collected from applications and infrastructure. Integrates seamlessly with Grafana for visualization.

*   **Message Queues:**
    *   **RabbitMQ (Primary Choice):**
        *   **Justification:** Mature, feature-rich (persistent messages, dead-letter exchanges, flexible routing options, message acknowledgments, priority queues), and widely adopted with good client library support across Java, Python, and .NET. Ideal for decoupling microservices and managing asynchronous tasks like email sending, AFP generation requests, and conversion jobs.
    *   **Apache Kafka (Alternative for high-throughput/event streaming):**
        *   **Justification:** Suitable if the system evolves to handle extremely high volumes of events or requires a durable, distributed log for event sourcing. More complex to manage than RabbitMQ and might be overkill for initial requirements but a good option for future scalability in event-driven scenarios.

*   **AFP Generation Specific Tools:**
    *   **Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor):**
        *   **Justification:** Open-source Java library that supports AFP output from XSL-FO input. Suitable for the Core AFP Generation Engine.
    *   **Barcode Libraries (e.g., Barcode4J for Java, python-barcode for Python):**
        *   **Justification:** To generate barcodes (Code 128, QR codes, etc.) that can be embedded as images within the AFP documents via FOP.
    *   **Charting Libraries (e.g., JFreeChart for Java, Matplotlib/Seaborn for Python if pre-generating images):**
        *   **Justification:** For generating charts as images that can be embedded into AFP documents. FOP itself has limited native charting capabilities.

*   **AFP Conversion Specific Tools:**
    *   **Commercial Conversion Engines (Primary approach):**
        *   **Justification:** As detailed in `AFP_Conversion_Module_Design.md`, high-fidelity conversion of complex AFP files (especially those using MO:DCA IS/3 features like FS45 color, complex overlays, and diverse font technologies) generally requires specialized commercial tools. Examples include solutions from Crawford Technologies, OpenText, Precisely, or Compart. The `AFPConversionService` will wrap such a tool.
    *   **Open Source (Limited, for basic needs or as fallback if specific features are not critical):**
        *   Ghostscript (with potential AFP input plugins, though often limited).
        *   Apache FOP (can render some AFP, but not a general-purpose converter).
        *   **Justification:** Lower cost, but likely significant limitations in feature support and fidelity for enterprise-grade AFP documents.

*   **API Gateway:**
    *   **Options:** Kong, Tyk (Open Source with commercial support), Spring Cloud Gateway (if Java/Spring ecosystem is dominant), AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, Google Cloud API Gateway.
    *   **Justification:** Provides a single entry point for external APIs, handling routing, authentication/authorization, rate limiting, logging, and SSL termination, as detailed in `RESTful_APIs_External_Integration_Design.md`. The specific choice depends on infrastructure (cloud vs. on-premise) and existing investments.

*   **Workflow Orchestration:**
    *   **Apache Airflow (Primary Choice):**
        *   **Justification:** Python-based, highly extensible, excellent for defining, scheduling, and monitoring complex batch workflows (DAGs) that involve multiple microservices. Good UI for operational management.
    *   **Alternative (Java-based):** A custom orchestration service using Spring Batch for job processing logic and a scheduler like Quartz, or a more lightweight workflow engine if Airflow is deemed too heavy.

*   **Caching:**
    *   **Redis (Primary Choice):**
        *   **Justification:** High-performance, in-memory data store, versatile (can be used for caching, session management, rate limiting counters, short-term job metadata). Widely supported.
    *   **Memcached (Alternative):**
        *   **Justification:** Simpler, pure in-memory key-value store, good for caching. Less feature-rich than Redis.
    *   **Use Cases:** Caching frequently accessed customer preferences, template structures, DNS MX records, API Gateway responses.

## 2. Infrastructure Considerations

*   **Deployment Strategy:**
    *   **Preferred Approach: Cloud-Native (AWS, Azure, or GCP)**
        *   **Pros:** Scalability on demand, managed services (databases, message queues, Kubernetes, API Gateways), pay-as-you-go, global reach, rich set of supporting services for logging, monitoring, security.
        *   **Cons:** Potential vendor lock-in, data residency/sovereignty concerns (must be addressed with region selection and data handling policies), potentially higher operational costs if not managed carefully.
    *   **On-Premise:**
        *   **Pros:** Full control over hardware and data, potentially lower long-term costs for stable workloads if existing infrastructure is leveraged, easier to meet strict data residency requirements.
        *   **Cons:** Higher upfront investment, responsibility for all infrastructure management (hardware, OS, networking, scaling, HA), slower to scale.
    *   **Hybrid:**
        *   **Pros:** Combines benefits, e.g., sensitive data/core processing on-premise, with scalable front-ends or specific services (like burstable conversion workers) in the cloud.
        *   **Cons:** Increased complexity in managing and integrating two different environments.
    *   **Recommendation:** Cloud-Native is generally preferred for new systems due to flexibility and scalability, but specific business constraints (security, data sovereignty, existing infrastructure) might dictate On-Premise or Hybrid.

*   **Containerization & Orchestration:**
    *   **Docker (for Containerization):**
        *   **Justification:** Standardizes the deployment unit for all microservices, ensuring consistency across environments (dev, test, prod). Simplifies dependency management.
    *   **Kubernetes (K8s - for Orchestration):**
        *   **Justification:** De facto standard for managing containerized applications at scale. Provides automated deployment, scaling, self-healing, service discovery, and load balancing. Managed Kubernetes services (EKS, AKS, GKE) reduce operational overhead.

*   **Scalability:**
    *   **Microservices:** Each microservice (AFP Generation, Conversion, Email Sender, etc.) can be scaled horizontally by running multiple instances, orchestrated by Kubernetes.
    *   **Databases:**
        *   PostgreSQL: Can be scaled using read replicas, connection pooling, and eventually sharding if write loads become extreme. Managed cloud database services offer easier scaling.
        *   MongoDB: Designed for horizontal scaling via sharding.
        *   Prometheus: Can be scaled with federation or solutions like Thanos/Cortex for long-term storage and global view.
    *   **Message Queues:**
        *   RabbitMQ: Can be clustered for high availability and load distribution.
        *   Kafka: Natively designed for horizontal scaling.
    *   **API Gateway:** Most API Gateway solutions are designed to be scalable.
    *   **Airflow:** Workers can be scaled out. CeleryExecutor with RabbitMQ/Redis or KubernetesExecutor provides scalability.

*   **High Availability (HA) & Disaster Recovery (DR):**
    *   **Redundancy:** Deploy multiple instances of each microservice, API Gateway, and Airflow component across different availability zones (in cloud) or physical servers (on-premise).
    *   **Load Balancing:** Use load balancers (cloud provider's LB, Nginx, HAProxy) in front of stateless services.
    *   **Database HA:** Use managed database services with HA configurations (e.g., automated failover to replicas) or set up primary-standby replication for self-managed databases.
    *   **Message Queue HA:** RabbitMQ clustering with mirrored queues. Kafka's distributed nature provides HA.
    *   **Backup & DR:**
        *   Regular automated backups for all persistent datastores (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Prometheus data if needed long-term).
        *   Test data restoration procedures.
        *   For DR, consider multi-region deployments for critical components or at least have a plan to redeploy and restore data in a different region/datacenter.

*   **Security Infrastructure Aspects (Brief Overview):**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Use Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, and firewalls/security groups to isolate different parts of the system (e.g., public-facing API Gateway, internal services, databases).
    *   **Secrets Management:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) for storing API keys, database credentials, private keys (for DKIM), etc. Do not hardcode secrets.
    *   **Secure Communication:**
        *   TLS for all external API communication (terminated at API Gateway).
        *   TLS for communication between API Gateway and internal microservices.
        *   TLS for internal service-to-service communication where sensitive data is exchanged.
        *   Secure connections to databases and message queues.
    *   (A full security design will be detailed in a subsequent document).

*   **Logging and Monitoring Infrastructure:**
    *   **Centralized Logging:**
        *   **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** Powerful and widely used for collecting, parsing, storing, and visualizing logs from all services and infrastructure components.
        *   **Grafana Loki:** A lighter-weight alternative, often paired with Prometheus for metrics, good for log aggregation and querying.
        *   Services should output logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to facilitate parsing.
    *   **Metrics Collection:**
        *   **Prometheus:** As mentioned, for collecting time-series metrics.
        *   Services expose metrics via a `/metrics` endpoint (standard for Prometheus).
    *   **Dashboarding & Visualization:**
        *   **Grafana:** For creating dashboards from Prometheus metrics and visualizing logs from Elasticsearch/Loki.
    *   **Alerting:**
        *   **Alertmanager (Prometheus ecosystem):** For defining alerts based on Prometheus metrics, handling deduplication, grouping, and routing alerts to various notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty).
        *   ElastAlert for alerting based on log patterns in Elasticsearch.
