# Security Considerations

This document outlines the security measures and principles for the AFP document generation, conversion, delivery, and management system. The goal is to establish a robust security posture that protects sensitive data and ensures the integrity and availability of the services.

## 1. Overall Security Design Principles

The following principles guide the security design of the entire system:

*   **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls. If one layer is breached, other layers are in place to mitigate the attack.
*   **Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users, services, and components to perform their intended functions.
*   **Secure by Design/Default:** Integrate security considerations into the design and development lifecycle from the beginning. Default configurations should be secure.
*   **Assume Breach:** Operate under the assumption that breaches will occur. Design systems to detect, contain, and recover from incidents quickly.
*   **Regular Audits and Updates:** Continuously review security configurations, audit logs, and update systems, libraries, and dependencies to address new vulnerabilities.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Isolate critical components and data to limit the impact of a security breach in one area.
*   **Data Minimization:** Collect and retain only the data that is absolutely necessary for the system's functionality.

## 2. Data Security

Protecting data is paramount, both when it is stored (at rest) and when it is being transmitted (in transit).

*   **Data at Rest Encryption:**
    *   **Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB):** Utilize transparent data encryption (TDE) features provided by the database systems or cloud providers (e.g., AWS RDS Encryption, Azure SQL TDE, MongoDB WiredTiger encryption at rest). Encrypt database backups.
    *   **Object Storage (S3, Azure Blob Storage):** Enable server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, Azure Storage Service Encryption) for all buckets storing AFP files, converted documents, templates, and logs.
    *   **Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka):** Encrypt messages persisted to disk. For RabbitMQ, this might involve encrypting the underlying file system or using plugins if available for message-level encryption. Kafka supports broker-side encryption.
    *   **Configuration and Secrets:** Sensitive configuration data (API keys, passwords, private keys for DKIM) must be stored in a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) and encrypted at rest. Do not store secrets in code repositories or configuration files directly.
    *   **Temporary Files:** Ensure any temporary files generated during conversion or processing (e.g., by Apache FOP or the conversion tool) are stored on encrypted file systems and securely deleted after use.
*   **Data in Transit Encryption:**
    *   **External APIs (API Gateway):** All external API endpoints must enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher) for all communication.
    *   **Internal Service-to-Service Communication:** Enforce TLS (preferably mTLS for mutual authentication) for all communication between microservices within the internal network. This includes calls between the API Gateway and backend services.
    *   **Database Connections:** Use TLS/SSL to encrypt connections from application services to databases.
    *   **Message Queue Connections:** Use TLS/SSL to encrypt connections from services to message brokers (e.g., AMQPS for RabbitMQ, SSL for Kafka).
    *   **SMTP Communication (Email Sender Service):**
        *   Enforce `STARTTLS` for sending emails to recipient mail servers.
        *   Use TLS for connections to any configured relay servers.
        *   Secure connections for bounce mailbox polling (IMAPS/POP3S).
*   **Sensitive Data Handling:**
    *   **Data Classification:** Classify data based on sensitivity (e.g., PII, financial data, confidential documents). Apply stricter controls to more sensitive data.
    *   **Minimization:** Only collect and process sensitive data that is absolutely necessary for the defined purpose. Avoid storing redundant copies.
    *   **Masking/Tokenization:** Where full data is not required for processing or display (e.g., in logs or some UI elements), consider masking parts of sensitive data (e.g., last 4 digits of an account number) or using tokenization for PII if appropriate.
    *   **Secure Disposal:** Implement secure methods for deleting data when it is no longer needed, in accordance with data retention policies and regulatory requirements. This includes shredding cryptographic keys if they are retired.
    *   **AFP Content:** Recognize that AFP documents themselves often contain highly sensitive information. Access to these documents at all stages (generation, storage, conversion, download) must be strictly controlled.

## 3. Access Control

Robust access control mechanisms are essential to ensure that only authorized entities (users and services) can access resources.

*   **API Authentication & Authorization (External):**
    *   **Authentication:** As defined in `RESTful_APIs_External_Integration_Design.md`, use **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant Flow** for machine-to-machine authentication. Clients will obtain JWT access tokens.
    *   **Authorization:** Use **OAuth Scopes** embedded in the JWT to enforce fine-grained permissions for specific API endpoints and operations. The API Gateway will be responsible for validating JWTs and enforcing scope-based authorization.
*   **User Authentication & Authorization (Internal UIs/Admin Panels):**
    *   This applies to UIs like the Visual Template Builder, Airflow UI, Grafana dashboards, or any custom admin interfaces.
    *   **Authentication:**
        *   Integrate with a centralized Identity Provider (IdP) supporting **SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC)** (e.g., Keycloak, Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace).
        *   Enforce **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all administrative users and users accessing sensitive functionalities.
    *   **Authorization:** Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. Define roles (e.g., `TemplateDesigner`, `Operator`, `SystemAdmin`, `Auditor`) with specific permissions. User permissions are derived from their assigned roles.
*   **Service-to-Service Authentication:**
    *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Preferred method for securing communication between internal microservices. Each service has its own certificate, and they mutually authenticate each other. This provides strong authentication and encryption.
    *   **JWTs (Service Accounts):** Alternatively, services can authenticate using JWTs obtained via a client credentials flow from a central OAuth server, specifically for service-to-service communication. These tokens would have scopes defining allowed inter-service operations.
*   **Infrastructure Access Control:**
    *   **Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Use cloud provider IAM roles and policies (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure RBAC, Google Cloud IAM) to control access to cloud resources (VMs, databases, storage, Kubernetes clusters). Apply the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Restricted SSH/RDP Access:**
        *   Disable direct SSH/RDP access to servers from the public internet.
        *   Use bastion hosts (jump boxes) in a secured subnet for necessary administrative access.
        *   Enforce key-based SSH authentication (disable password authentication).
        *   Log all administrative access.
    *   **Kubernetes RBAC:** Use Kubernetes RBAC to control access to the Kubernetes API and resources within clusters.

## 4. Audit Trails and Logging

Comprehensive logging and auditing are critical for security monitoring, incident investigation, and compliance.

*   **Comprehensive Logging of Security Events:**
    *   Authentication successes and failures (API, UI, service-to-service).
    *   Authorization denials.
    *   Changes to security configurations (permissions, firewall rules, user roles).
    *   Access to sensitive data (e.g., downloading a statement, viewing customer PII if applicable).
    *   Administrative actions (e.g., deploying new services, starting/stopping batch jobs).
    *   Key lifecycle events of resources (e.g., template creation/modification, communication job submission).
    *   All logs should include timestamps, source IP, user/service ID, event type, and outcome.
*   **Centralized and Secure Log Storage:**
    *   Use a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack, Grafana Loki, Splunk, or cloud-native solutions like AWS CloudWatch Logs, Azure Monitor Logs).
    *   Ensure log storage is immutable or tamper-evident.
    *   Protect log data with strict access controls and encryption at rest.
    *   Implement log retention policies based on compliance requirements and operational needs.
*   **Regular Log Review and Alerting:**
    *   Implement automated alerts for suspicious activities or critical security events (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts, critical system errors).
    *   Use tools like Alertmanager (Prometheus ecosystem) or specific features of the log management platform.
    *   Conduct regular (manual or semi-automated) reviews of audit logs to detect anomalies that automated alerts might miss.

## 5. Application Security

Secure development practices and runtime protections are crucial.

*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Validate all input data on the server-side for type, format, length, range, and allowed characters. This applies to API request parameters, JSON payloads, form submissions, and data from upstream services.
    *   Protect against common injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection) by using parameterized queries, context-aware output encoding, and avoiding direct execution of unsanitized input.
*   **Output Encoding:**
    *   Encode data appropriately when rendering it in user interfaces (HTML, JavaScript) or including it in structured formats (XML, JSON being sent to other systems) to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
*   **Secure Coding Practices (OWASP):**
    *   Follow guidelines from OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project), such as the OWASP Top 10, during development.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews with a focus on security.
    *   Use static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in code.
*   **Dependency Management & Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   Keep all third-party libraries, frameworks, and dependencies up-to-date.
    *   Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, Dependabot) to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Establish a process for patching or mitigating vulnerabilities in dependencies promptly.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   Deploy a WAF in front of all public-facing web applications and APIs (including the API Gateway and any UIs).
    *   Configure WAF rules to protect against common web attacks (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc.) and to block known malicious traffic patterns. Cloud providers often offer managed WAF services.

## 6. Network Security

Protecting the network infrastructure is a fundamental layer of defense.

*   **Firewalls/Security Groups:**
    *   Implement strict firewall rules (or cloud security group rules) to control inbound and outbound traffic at network perimeters and between internal subnets.
    *   Default-deny: Block all traffic by default and only allow necessary ports and protocols between specific sources and destinations.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    *   Deploy IDS/IPS solutions to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and known attack signatures.
    *   An IPS can automatically block malicious traffic.
    *   Cloud providers offer native IDS/IPS services.
*   **DDoS Protection:**
    *   Utilize DDoS mitigation services (e.g., AWS Shield, Azure DDoS Protection, Cloudflare) to protect against Distributed Denial of Service attacks, especially for public-facing endpoints.

## 7. Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

The system must adhere to relevant data protection and privacy regulations.

*   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) / PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act) / CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) etc.:**
    *   Implement mechanisms for consent management, data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability), and data breach notification as outlined in the `Electronic_Communication_Platform_Design.md` (CustomerProfileService section).
    *   Ensure data processing agreements are in place with any third-party subprocessors (e.g., SMS gateways, email providers, cloud hosting).
    *   Data Processing Impact Assessments (DPIAs) may be required.
*   **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):**
    *   **Applicability:** If the system processes, stores, or transmits cardholder data (e.g., if statements contain full credit card numbers, which should be avoided if possible), then PCI DSS compliance is mandatory.
    *   **Measures:** If applicable, this would require strict adherence to all PCI DSS requirements, including network segmentation for the cardholder data environment (CDE), strong access control, regular vulnerability scanning by an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV), penetration testing, and specific logging/monitoring. This significantly increases the security burden and complexity. **The current design aims to avoid direct handling of payment card primary account numbers (PANs) in generated documents where possible.**
*   **Other Industry-Specific Regulations:**
    *   Depending on the industry the system serves (e.g., healthcare with HIPAA, finance with SOX), additional specific compliance requirements may apply. These must be identified and addressed.

## 8. Incident Response Plan

While not a full plan, this outlines the need and key components.

*   **Need:** A documented Incident Response (IR) Plan is crucial for effectively responding to security incidents, minimizing damage, and ensuring timely recovery.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Preparation:** Defining roles and responsibilities, training, tools, and communication channels.
    *   **Identification:** How incidents are detected (monitoring, alerts, user reports) and reported.
    *   **Containment:** Steps to limit the scope and impact of an incident.
    *   **Eradication:** Removing the root cause of the incident.
    *   **Recovery:** Restoring affected systems and services to normal operation.
    *   **Lessons Learned (Post-Incident Analysis):** Reviewing the incident and response to identify areas for improvement.
    *   Regularly test the IR plan through tabletop exercises or simulations.

## 9. Security Testing

Proactive security testing is vital to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

*   **Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular penetration tests (e.g., annually and after significant changes) performed by qualified third-party security professionals.
    *   This simulates real-world attacks to identify exploitable vulnerabilities in APIs, applications, and infrastructure.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   Implement automated vulnerability scanning for:
        *   Operating systems and infrastructure components.
        *   Application code (SAST, DAST - Dynamic Application Security Testing).
        *   Container images.
        *   Third-party dependencies (SCA).
    *   Integrate scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to detect issues early.
*   **Security Audits:**
    *   Periodically audit configurations of critical systems (firewalls, IAM, databases, Kubernetes) against security best practices and defined baselines.

By implementing these security considerations, the system can achieve a strong security posture, protecting sensitive information and maintaining the trust of its users and stakeholders.
