# Deployment and Maintenance Plan

This document outlines the deployment and ongoing maintenance strategies for the AFP document generation, conversion, delivery, and management system. The aim is to establish a clear operational framework for deploying, managing, and updating the system reliably and efficiently.

## 1. Deployment Strategy & Process

A modern, automated approach to deployment will be adopted, leveraging containerization, orchestration, CI/CD, and Infrastructure as Code.

*   **Containerization (Docker):**
    *   All microservices (Core AFP Generation Engine, AFP Conversion Module, Email Sender Service, SMSSenderService, AppPushService, CustomerProfileService, DispatchService, API Gateway components if self-hosted, etc.) will be packaged as Docker containers.
    *   **Benefits:** Consistent environments across development, testing, and production; simplified dependency management; isolation of services; faster deployments.
    *   Dockerfiles will be maintained for each service to define the build process for its container image.
    *   Container images will be stored in a private container registry (e.g., AWS ECR, Azure ACR, Google GCR, Harbor).

*   **Orchestration (Kubernetes - K8s):**
    *   Kubernetes will be used to orchestrate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
    *   **Benefits:** Automated rollouts and rollbacks, service discovery, load balancing, self-healing (restarting failed containers), horizontal scaling, configuration management.
    *   Kubernetes manifests (YAML files defining Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Ingress, etc.) will be created for each microservice.
    *   Managed Kubernetes services (EKS, AKS, GKE) are recommended for cloud deployments to reduce operational overhead.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   A robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is essential for automated and reliable deployments.
    *   **Tools:** Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines.
    *   **Pipeline Stages:**
        1.  **Code Commit:** Developer commits code to a Git repository (e.g., GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket).
        2.  **Build & Unit Test:**
            *   CI server triggers a build.
            *   Source code is compiled.
            *   Automated unit tests are executed. If tests fail, the build fails.
        3.  **Static Code Analysis & Security Scan (SAST/SCA):**
            *   Code is analyzed for quality issues and known vulnerabilities (e.g., SonarQube, OWASP Dependency-Check).
        4.  **Containerize:**
            *   If build and tests pass, a Docker image is built and tagged (e.g., with Git commit hash and/or version number).
            *   Image is pushed to the private container registry.
        5.  **Deploy to Dev/Test Environment:**
            *   Automated deployment of the new image to a dedicated development or testing Kubernetes namespace/cluster.
        6.  **Automated Integration & E2E Tests:**
            *   Automated integration tests and critical end-to-end tests are run against the deployed application in the dev/test environment.
        7.  **Deploy to Staging Environment:**
            *   If all previous stages pass, automated or manual promotion to the Staging environment (a production replica).
        8.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
            *   Stakeholders perform UAT in the Staging environment.
            *   Performance and more extensive security tests (e.g., DAST) may also be run here.
        9.  **Approval for Production Deployment:**
            *   Manual approval gate based on successful UAT and test results.
        10. **Deploy to Production:**
            *   Deployment to the production Kubernetes cluster using a chosen strategy (see below).
        11. **Post-Deployment Monitoring & Smoke Tests:**
            *   Monitor key metrics and logs immediately after deployment.
            *   Run automated smoke tests to verify critical functionality in production.

*   **Production Deployment Strategies:**
    *   **Rolling Update (Default Kubernetes Strategy):**
        *   Gradually replaces old versions of application instances with new ones, one by one or in batches.
        *   Ensures zero downtime if new version is stable.
        *   Can be configured with readiness and liveness probes to ensure new instances are healthy before traffic is shifted.
        *   **Recommendation:** Suitable for most microservice updates.
    *   **Blue/Green Deployment:**
        *   Two identical production environments ("Blue" and "Green") are maintained. Only one environment is live at any time.
        *   Deploy the new version to the idle environment (e.g., Green).
        *   After testing the Green environment, switch traffic from Blue to Green.
        *   **Pros:** Instant rollback by switching traffic back to Blue if issues occur.
        *   **Cons:** Requires double the infrastructure resources.
        *   **Recommendation:** Consider for critical services or major updates where rollback risk is high.
    *   **Canary Deployment:**
        *   Release the new version to a small subset of users/traffic.
        *   Monitor performance and errors closely.
        *   If stable, gradually roll out the new version to the rest of the users/traffic.
        *   **Pros:** Limits the impact of a faulty release. Allows for real-world testing with a small blast radius.
        *   **Cons:** More complex to set up and manage traffic routing (often requires service mesh like Istio or Linkerd, or advanced Ingress controller features).
        *   **Recommendation:** Advanced strategy, useful for high-risk changes or when A/B testing features.

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    *   Manage and provision infrastructure (VPCs, subnets, Kubernetes clusters, databases, message queues, load balancers) using code.
    *   **Tools:** Terraform (cloud-agnostic), AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Google Cloud Deployment Manager.
    *   **Benefits:** Repeatable and consistent environments, version control for infrastructure, automated provisioning, reduced manual errors.

*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   **Kubernetes ConfigMaps:** Store non-sensitive configuration data (e.g., application settings, resource paths, default values) as ConfigMaps in Kubernetes. These can be mounted as files or environment variables into containers.
    *   **Kubernetes Secrets:** Store sensitive configuration data (API keys, database passwords, TLS certificates, DKIM private keys) as Kubernetes Secrets. These are base64 encoded (not truly encrypted at rest by default in etcd, so ensure etcd encryption is enabled or use an external secrets manager).
    *   **External Secrets Management (Recommended for higher security):** Integrate Kubernetes with systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to securely inject secrets into pods at runtime. This avoids storing sensitive data directly in Kubernetes etcd.

## 2. Ongoing Maintenance

Regular maintenance is crucial for security, stability, and performance.

*   **Regular Patching and Updates:**
    *   **Operating Systems (OS):** Apply security patches to the underlying OS of Kubernetes nodes and any other VMs regularly. Use automated patching where possible.
    *   **Kubernetes Versions:** Plan for and execute Kubernetes version upgrades (control plane and nodes) to stay on supported versions and get new features/security fixes. This should be tested in Staging first.
    *   **Base Docker Images:** Regularly update the base images used for service containers to include the latest security patches. Rebuild and redeploy applications with updated base images.
    *   **Application Dependencies:** Regularly scan and update third-party libraries and dependencies for all microservices to address known vulnerabilities (using tools like Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check).
    *   **Application Code:** Deploy bug fixes and minor improvements as needed through the CI/CD pipeline.

*   **Database Maintenance:**
    *   **Backups:** Implement automated daily backups for all databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB). Ensure backups are stored securely (encrypted) and in a separate location (e.g., different region). Regularly test the restoration process.
    *   **Performance Tuning:** Monitor database performance (query execution times, index usage, connection pooling). Optimize slow queries, add/remove indexes as needed.
    *   **Capacity Management:** Monitor disk space, CPU, and memory usage. Plan for capacity upgrades or scaling as data grows.
    *   **Upgrades:** Plan and execute database engine version upgrades to stay supported and benefit from new features/performance improvements. Test thoroughly in Staging.

*   **Message Queue Maintenance:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor queue depths, message rates, consumer acknowledgments, and resource usage of the message broker (RabbitMQ, Kafka).
    *   **Clustering/HA:** Ensure cluster health and data replication (e.g., mirrored queues in RabbitMQ) are functioning correctly.
    *   **Upgrades:** Plan and execute broker version upgrades.
    *   **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) Management:** Regularly review messages in DLQs to identify and address persistent processing failures.

*   **AFP Resource Management (Fonts, Overlays, Page Segments):**
    *   Establish a centralized and version-controlled repository for AFP resources (fonts, overlays, page segments, form definitions).
    *   Ensure the `AFPGenerationService` and `AFPConversionService` (or the underlying conversion tool) have access to the correct versions of these resources.
    *   Implement a process for updating these resources, which may involve updating configuration paths and potentially redeploying services if they cache these resources.

*   **Log Management and Archival:**
    *   **Rotation:** Implement log rotation for application and system logs on servers/containers to prevent disk space exhaustion.
    *   **Centralized Storage:** Ensure logs are shipped to a centralized logging system (ELK, Loki).
    *   **Archival:** Define log retention policies based on compliance and operational needs. Archive older logs from the hot storage of the centralized system to cheaper, long-term storage (e.g., AWS S3 Glacier, Azure Blob Archive).
    *   **Access Control:** Ensure access to archived logs is controlled and auditable.

*   **SSL/TLS Certificate Management:**
    *   **Monitoring Expiration:** Implement automated monitoring and alerting for SSL/TLS certificate expiration dates (for public-facing endpoints, internal mTLS certificates, etc.).
    *   **Automated Renewal:** Use tools like Let's Encrypt with cert-manager (for Kubernetes) to automate the issuance and renewal of publicly trusted TLS certificates.
    *   **Private CA:** For internal mTLS, use a private Certificate Authority (CA). Establish procedures for issuing and renewing service certificates.

## 3. System Monitoring

Consolidating discussions from previous design documents (especially `Batch_Processing_And_Reporting_Design.md`).

*   **Metrics Collection:**
    *   **Prometheus:** Primary tool for collecting time-series metrics from all microservices, Kubernetes, databases, and other infrastructure components. Services will expose a `/metrics` endpoint.
*   **Centralized Logging:**
    *   **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana Loki:** For collecting, storing, searching, and analyzing logs from all components.
*   **Dashboarding:**
    *   **Grafana:** To create dashboards for visualizing Prometheus metrics and logs from ELK/Loki. Dashboards will cover system health, service performance, business KPIs, and batch job status.
*   **Alerting:**
    *   **Alertmanager (Prometheus ecosystem):** For defining alerts based on metrics (e.g., high error rates, high latency, resource exhaustion, queue backlogs, failed batch jobs). Alerts routed to appropriate channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty).
    *   Alerts can also be configured based on log patterns in the centralized logging system.
*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):**
    *   **Need:** For deeper insights into application performance, distributed tracing across microservice calls, and identifying bottlenecks within application code.
    *   **Tools (Examples):** Jaeger (open source for tracing), Zipkin (open source for tracing), Dynatrace, New Relic, Datadog APM, Elastic APM.
    *   Integration with APM tools would involve instrumenting application code using APM agents or libraries.
*   **Key Areas to Monitor (Summary):**
    *   API Gateway: Request rates, error rates, latency.
    *   Core Services (AFP Gen, Conversion, Email/SMS/Push Senders, Dispatch, Customer Profile, Template Mgmt): Throughput, error rates, processing latency, resource utilization, queue depths.
    *   Batch Orchestrator (Airflow): DAG run status, task failures, scheduler health, worker availability.
    *   Databases: Query performance, connection counts, replication status, disk space, CPU/memory.
    *   Message Queues: Queue depths, message rates, consumer health.
    *   Infrastructure: Kubernetes cluster health, node resource utilization, network I/O.
    *   Security: Authentication failures, WAF alerts, IDS/IPS alerts.

## 4. Updates and Upgrades

Managing changes to the system once it's in production.

*   **Minor Updates vs. Major Version Upgrades:**
    *   **Minor Updates:** Bug fixes, small non-breaking feature enhancements, security patches. Deployed via the standard CI/CD pipeline using rolling updates. API version remains the same.
    *   **Major Version Upgrades:** Introduce breaking changes to APIs or significant changes in functionality.
        *   **API Versioning:** A new API version will be introduced (e.g., `/api/v2/...`). The old version (`/api/v1/...`) should be supported in parallel for a defined deprecation period to allow clients to migrate.
        *   **Deprecation Policy:** Clearly communicate API deprecation timelines and provide migration guides.
        *   Deployment might involve Blue/Green or Canary strategies for careful rollout.
*   **Database Schema Migrations:**
    *   **Tools:** Flyway (Java-focused) or Liquibase (more language-agnostic).
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Migration scripts are version-controlled alongside application code.
        2.  Migrations are applied automatically as part of the deployment process (often before the new application version starts or as a dedicated step in the pipeline).
        3.  Ensure migrations are backward-compatible if possible, or coordinate application and database deployments carefully to avoid downtime (e.g., expand-contract pattern for complex changes).
        4.  Test migrations thoroughly in Staging.
        5.  Have a rollback plan for failed migrations (though some migrations are hard to roll back directly and might require restoring from backup if catastrophic).
*   **Rollback Strategy:**
    *   **Automated Rollbacks (Kubernetes):** Kubernetes `Deployment` objects support automated rollbacks to a previous version if a new deployment fails health checks or is manually triggered.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Support:** The CI/CD pipeline should have a mechanism to easily redeploy a previous stable version.
    *   **Database Rollbacks:** More complex. For schema changes, it might involve applying a "down" migration script (if written) or restoring from backup. For data changes, specific rollback logic might be needed.
    *   **Blue/Green:** Simplifies rollback by just switching traffic back to the old environment.
    *   Test rollback procedures regularly.

## 5. Documentation

Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation is crucial for operations and maintenance. All documentation should be stored in a version-controlled repository (e.g., alongside the code or in a dedicated docs-as-code repository).

*   **System Architecture Document:** The overall design document you are currently creating, detailing microservices, their interactions, data flows, and technology choices.
*   **API Specifications:**
    *   OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for all external RESTful APIs.
    *   Internal API contracts if using different mechanisms (e.g., gRPC .proto files).
*   **Deployment Guides:**
    *   Step-by-step instructions for deploying the system (or individual services) to different environments.
    *   Kubernetes manifest details and configuration options.
    *   CI/CD pipeline setup and operation.
*   **Troubleshooting Guides / Runbooks:**
    *   Common issues, their symptoms, and steps to diagnose and resolve them.
    *   Procedures for handling common alerts.
    *   Contact information for different support levels/teams.
*   **Incident Response (IR) Plan:**
    *   Detailed plan as outlined in `Security_Considerations.md`.
*   **Maintenance Procedures:**
    *   Step-by-step instructions for routine maintenance tasks (patching, backups, certificate renewal, resource updates, etc.).
    *   Checklists for pre- and post-maintenance activities.
*   **User Manuals (for Visual Template Builder, Admin UIs):**
    *   Guides for end-users on how to use the system's interfaces.

This plan provides a framework for deploying and maintaining the system. It will require continuous refinement as the system is built and evolves.The `Deployment_and_Maintenance_Plan.md` document has been successfully created. It covers all the requested sections:

1.  **Deployment Strategy & Process:** Details on containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), CI/CD pipeline stages and tools, production deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling Update), Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), and Configuration Management (Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets).
2.  **Ongoing Maintenance:** Strategies for regular patching (OS, Kubernetes, base images, dependencies), database maintenance, message queue maintenance, AFP resource management, log management/archival, and SSL/TLS certificate management.
3.  **System Monitoring:** Consolidation of monitoring tools (Prometheus, ELK/Loki, Grafana, Alertmanager), mention of APM, and key areas to monitor.
4.  **Updates and Upgrades:** Differentiation between minor updates and major version upgrades (including API versioning/deprecation), database schema migration strategies (Flyway/Liquibase), and rollback strategies.
5.  **Documentation:** Lists essential documentation types (system architecture, API specs, deployment/troubleshooting guides, IR plan, maintenance procedures, user manuals).

This document provides a clear operational framework for the system.
