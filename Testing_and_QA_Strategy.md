# Testing and Quality Assurance (QA) Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing and quality assurance strategy for the AFP document generation, conversion, delivery, and management system. The goal is to ensure the system is reliable, performs as expected, is secure, and meets user requirements.

## 1. Testing Levels & Types

A multi-layered testing approach will be adopted, encompassing various levels and types of testing.

### a. Unit Testing

*   **Focus:** Testing individual components or units of code (e.g., a specific class, method, or function) in isolation. Verifying that each unit performs its specific function correctly.
*   **Responsibility:** Primarily developers writing the code.
*   **Tools:**
    *   Java: JUnit, Mockito, AssertJ
    *   Python: unittest, pytest, mock
    *   .NET: MSTest, NUnit, Moq
    *   JavaScript (for UI components): Jest, Mocha, Jasmine
*   **Coverage Examples:**
    *   Testing a data mapping function in the `AFPGenerationService` with various input data and expected output.
    *   Testing an MX record lookup function in the `EmailSenderService`.
    *   Testing a specific template variable substitution in the `TemplateManagementService`.
    *   Testing an AFP resource parsing utility.
    *   Verifying error handling for invalid inputs in an API controller.
    *   Aim for high code coverage (e.g., >80%) for critical components.

### b. Integration Testing

*   **Focus:** Testing the interaction between different components or microservices to ensure they work together as intended. Verifying data exchange, API calls, and communication via message queues.
*   **Responsibility:** Developers, with potential support from QA engineers.
*   **Tools:**
    *   Java: Spring Boot Test (for testing Spring components, controllers, service interactions), Testcontainers (for testing with real dependencies like databases or message queues in Docker containers).
    *   Python: pytest, requests (for API calls), Boto3 (for AWS services if applicable).
    *   .NET: Integration testing features in ASP.NET Core, Testcontainers.
    *   Message Queue Testing: Tools to publish/consume messages from RabbitMQ/Kafka and assert content/behavior.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Testing the flow from `AFPGenerationService` placing a message on a queue, to `AFPConversionService` picking it up and processing it.
    *   Testing an API call from the `BatchOrchestrationService` (e.g., Airflow DAG) to the `AFPGenerationService` API.
    *   Verifying that the `EmailSenderService` correctly retrieves DKIM keys and signs an email.
    *   Testing database interactions: ensuring a service correctly reads from or writes to a database schema.
    *   Testing interactions with the API Gateway for routing and basic auth.

### c. End-to-End (E2E) / System Testing

*   **Focus:** Testing the entire system workflow from the user's or external system's perspective. Verifying that all integrated components function correctly together to achieve a business objective. This simulates real user scenarios.
*   **Responsibility:** Primarily QA engineers, with support from developers for setup and debugging.
*   **Tools:**
    *   API Testing: Postman (manual and automated), RestAssured (Java), requests (Python), Cypress (can also do API tests).
    *   UI Testing (for Visual Template Builder): Selenium, Cypress, Playwright.
    *   Custom test scripts for orchestrating complex flows.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Batch Processing E2E Test:**
        1.  Trigger a batch job via Airflow (or its API).
        2.  Verify that input data is correctly fetched.
        3.  Verify AFP files are generated and stored.
        4.  Verify AFP files are converted to the target format (e.g., PDF).
        5.  Verify emails are assembled with correct attachments/links.
        6.  Verify emails are sent (using a test SMTP server or mail trap service like MailHog/Mailtrap).
        7.  Verify status updates are correctly reflected via API or in the database.
    *   **Real-time API E2E Test:**
        1.  External system calls an API endpoint (e.g., to request a statement download or resend an email).
        2.  Verify the API Gateway routes the request correctly.
        3.  Verify the backend service processes the request.
        4.  Verify the expected output (file download, successful resend queueing).
        5.  Verify correct status codes and response bodies.
    *   **Visual Template Builder E2E Test:**
        1.  User creates a new template via UI.
        2.  User adds various elements (text, image placeholders, data placeholders).
        3.  User saves the template.
        4.  Verify the template is correctly stored via `TemplateManagementService` API.
        5.  Use this template in a test generation flow to ensure output matches design.

### d. Performance Testing

*   **Focus:** Evaluating the system's responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various load conditions.
*   **Responsibility:** Performance engineers or specialized QA engineers, with support from developers and DevOps.
*   **Tools:**
    *   Load Testing: Apache JMeter, K6, Gatling, Locust.
    *   Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, APM tools (e.g., Dynatrace, New Relic, Elastic APM).
*   **Types:**
    *   **Load Testing:** Simulate expected production load to verify system performance against defined SLAs (response times, throughput).
    *   **Stress Testing:** Push the system beyond its normal operating limits to identify breaking points, resource bottlenecks, and how it recovers.
    *   **Soak Testing (Endurance Testing):** Run the system under a sustained moderate load for an extended period to detect issues like memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or performance degradation over time.
    *   **Spike Testing:** Observe system behavior when subjected to sudden bursts of traffic.
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   API Response Times (average, 95th/99th percentile).
    *   Throughput (requests per second, messages processed per minute).
    *   Error Rates under load.
    *   Resource Utilization (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O) of services, databases, message queues.
    *   Queue lengths and message processing latency.
    *   Database query performance.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Simulate 1000s of concurrent API requests to the API Gateway.
    *   Generate a large batch of 100,000 AFP generation requests and measure the time to completion and resource usage.
    *   Test the `EmailSenderService` with a high volume of emails to check sending rate and SMTP connection handling.
    *   Measure the performance of the AFP conversion process for large or complex AFP files.

### e. Security Testing

*   **Focus:** Identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in the system.
*   **Responsibility:** Security team or specialized security QA, often involving third-party penetration testers.
*   **Reference:** Detailed security measures are outlined in `Security_Considerations.md`.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated scanning of code (SAST), running applications (DAST), container images, and infrastructure.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Authorized simulated attacks on the system to identify exploitable weaknesses.
    *   **API Security Testing:** Focus on authentication, authorization (scope enforcement), input validation for API endpoints, protection against common API attacks.
    *   **Security Audits:** Review of configurations, access controls, and compliance with security policies.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Checking third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities.

### f. Usability Testing

*   **Focus:** Evaluating the ease of use, intuitiveness, and user experience of the system's user interfaces, primarily the Visual Template Builder and any administrative dashboards.
*   **Responsibility:** UX designers and QA engineers, involving actual or representative users.
*   **Methods:**
    *   Conducting user testing sessions with predefined tasks.
    *   Gathering feedback through surveys, interviews, and observation.
    *   Heuristic evaluation against usability principles.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Can a user easily create a new AFP template with dynamic fields?
    *   Is the process for managing customer communication preferences clear?
    *   Can an operator easily monitor batch job status and identify errors in Airflow/Grafana?

### g. Compatibility Testing

*   **Focus:** Ensuring the system's outputs and interfaces work correctly across different environments and client software.
*   **Responsibility:** QA engineers.
*   **Types:**
    *   **AFP Viewer Compatibility:** Test generated AFP files with various common AFP viewers (e.g., IBM AFP Workbench, Ricoh ProcessDirector AFP Viewer, Papyrus AFP Viewer) to ensure correct rendering of text, images, overlays, and fonts.
    *   **PDF Reader Compatibility:** Test converted PDF/PDF/A files with different PDF readers (Adobe Acrobat Reader, common browser PDF viewers, Foxit Reader) for rendering accuracy and PDF/A compliance validation.
    *   **Browser Compatibility:** Test web UIs (Visual Template Builder, admin panels) across different major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) and versions.
    *   **Email Client Compatibility:** Test HTML emails rendered by different email clients (Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail, web clients) as rendering can vary. (Tools like Litmus or Email on Acid can assist).

### h. Failover and Resilience Testing (Chaos Engineering)

*   **Focus:** Verifying the system's ability to withstand failures of components or infrastructure and recover gracefully.
*   **Responsibility:** DevOps, SREs, and QA engineers.
*   **Methods (Chaos Engineering principles):**
    *   Intentionally inject failures into a test environment (e.g., shut down a service instance, introduce network latency, make a database replica unavailable).
    *   Observe how the system responds:
        *   Does it failover to redundant components?
        *   Are alerts triggered?
        *   How does it impact overall system availability and data integrity?
        *   Does it recover automatically when the fault is removed?
*   **Tools:** Chaos Monkey (Netflix), Gremlin, custom scripts.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Simulate failure of a RabbitMQ node to ensure messages are not lost and consumers reconnect.
    *   Take down an instance of the `AFPConversionService` to see if requests are routed to other instances or queued appropriately.
    *   Simulate database failover.
    *   Test API Gateway's ability to handle backend service unavailability (e.g., circuit breaker pattern).

## 2. Test Environments

A series of isolated environments will be used for different stages of testing and development:

*   **Development (Dev):**
    *   Individual developer environments (local machines or cloud-based dev instances).
    *   Used for coding, unit testing, and initial component-level integration testing.
    *   May use mocks or lightweight local versions of dependent services (e.g., local RabbitMQ, in-memory DB).
*   **CI/Build Environment:**
    *   Used by the Continuous Integration server (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
    *   Automated builds, unit tests, and potentially some integration tests are run here on every code commit.
    *   May use Testcontainers to spin up ephemeral dependencies.
*   **QA/Testing Environment:**
    *   A stable environment deployed with the latest successful build from CI.
    *   Used by QA engineers for most functional testing, integration testing, E2E testing, and exploratory testing.
    *   Should be as close to production as possible in terms of configuration and integrated services (may use shared, but isolated, instances of databases, message queues).
*   **Staging/Pre-Production Environment:**
    *   A complete replica of the production environment (or as close as feasible).
    *   Used for final E2E testing, UAT, performance testing, and failover/resilience testing.
    *   Uses production-like data (anonymized if necessary).
    *   Deployments to production are typically promoted from this environment after successful validation.
*   **Production Environment:**
    *   The live system used by end-users and external systems.
    *   Monitoring and smoke testing are performed here, but extensive QA activities are avoided.

## 3. Test Data Management

Effective testing requires appropriate and well-managed test data.

*   **Need for Realistic and Diverse Data:**
    *   Test data must cover a wide range of scenarios, including valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases, and large volumes.
    *   For AFP generation, this includes diverse customer data, various template complexities, different image types, and font requirements.
*   **AFP Specific Data:**
    *   A library of sample AFP files with varying features (different MO:DCA levels, IOCA images, GOCA graphics, diverse font technologies, overlays, page segments, bar codes) will be maintained. This is crucial for testing the `AFPConversionService`.
    *   Sample XSL-FO files or template designs for testing the `AFPGenerationService`.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Empty input files, very large files, files with missing resources, data with special characters, requests with missing optional fields, etc.
*   **PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Anonymization:**
    *   For testing in QA and Staging environments, production data (if used) **must be anonymized or masked** to protect PII and comply with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
    *   Develop scripts or use tools to generate anonymized data sets that retain realistic characteristics.
*   **Tools/Scripts:**
    *   Data generation scripts (Python, Java) to create structured test data (JSON, CSV).
    *   Tools for database cloning/subsetting and anonymization.
    *   Version control test data alongside test scripts where appropriate.

## 4. Test Automation Strategy

Automation is key to achieving efficient and repeatable testing.

*   **Automate Extensively:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Should be fully automated and cover a significant portion of the codebase.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Automate tests for API interactions, message queue communication, and database interactions.
    *   **E2E Tests:** Automate critical end-to-end user scenarios and API workflows.
    *   **Performance Tests:** Scripts for load, stress, and soak testing should be automated.
    *   **Security Scans:** Integrate automated security scanning tools into CI/CD.
*   **CI/CD Integration:**
    *   Automated tests (unit, integration) will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Builds should fail if critical tests do not pass.
    *   Automated E2E tests can be triggered on deployment to QA/Staging environments.
*   **Test Pyramid Concept:**
    *   Emphasize a higher volume of unit tests at the base, followed by fewer integration tests, and even fewer E2E tests at the top.
    *   Unit tests are fast, cheap, and provide quick feedback. E2E tests are slower and more expensive but validate the entire system flow.

## 5. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

*   **Focus:** Validating that the system meets the business requirements and is acceptable to the end-users or stakeholders.
*   **Responsibility:** Business analysts, product owners, and representatives from the end-user community, with support from QA and development teams.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Define UAT scope and criteria based on business requirements.
    2.  Prepare UAT test cases representing real-world user scenarios.
    3.  Conduct UAT in the Staging/Pre-Production environment.
    4.  Users execute test cases and provide feedback.
    5.  Defects found during UAT are logged and prioritized.
*   **Sign-off:** Formal sign-off from business stakeholders is required before deploying to production, indicating that the system meets their requirements.

## 6. Defect Management

A structured process for identifying, tracking, and resolving defects.

*   **Defect Tracking System:** Use a dedicated tool (e.g., Jira, Bugzilla, Azure DevOps Boards) to log and manage defects.
*   **Defect Lifecycle:** Define a clear lifecycle for defects (e.g., New, Open, Assigned, In Progress, Ready for Retest, Retest, Closed, Reopened, Deferred).
*   **Severity and Priority:**
    *   **Severity:** Impact of the defect on the system (e.g., Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial).
    *   **Priority:** Urgency of fixing the defect (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
    *   These are assigned during defect logging and reviewed during triage.
*   **Triage Process:** Regular meetings (e.g., daily or weekly) involving QA, Development, and Product Management to review new defects, assign severity/priority, and plan for resolution.

## 7. QA Team Roles and Responsibilities (Brief Outline)

*   **QA Lead/Manager:**
    *   Defines and oversees the overall QA strategy.
    *   Manages QA resources, planning, and reporting.
    *   Advocates for quality within the development lifecycle.
